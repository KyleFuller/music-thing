# music-thing (NO LONGER MAINTAINED)

### What is this?
The goal of this project is to eventually create one or more libraries, in Python and/or other languages, for composing and reasoning about music computationally.

More precisely, the project aims to provide the following functionality:
* Convenient and flexible expression of musical sounds that can be played.
* Formalization of musical concepts in a formal theory, and checking of proofs about these concepts.

With these two things, one should be able first define one or more finite or infinite sequences of "notes" in either a purely algorithmic manner or by reasoning in the logical system, and then mapping the "notes" to produce sequences of sounds, with durations, that can be played as melodic lines in harmony.

This project is currently in its very early stages and is still quite exploratory.  As such, nothing should be considered stable.
